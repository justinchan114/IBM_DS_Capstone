# IBM_DS_Capstone

This is the applied data science capstone project for IBM Data Science Certificate from Coursera.

The project aims to predict the outcome of SpaceX first stage rocket landing, and includes 5 parts:
1. Data collection through SpaceX API and web scraping from Wikipedia
2. Data wrangling of the collected data
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including preliminary visualization and SQL exercise
4. Interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
5. Machine learning with different models for predicting landing outcome

Slight difference might be observed from files generated by the notebook (output and csv files). This is due to the fact that there are slight changes from SpaceX API with course material, as well as other discrepancies in course materials with web data. To make the output comparible to course material, most of the input files (CSV files) are the downloaded version from IBM course.
